# Experiments
Enables Discord staff "experiments", which are generally prototypes of features before they're released on Discord Canary, PTB, or stable.

To use the experiments, simply go to the new Experiments tab in user settings and find the options you want to use.

**Note: Because using experiments involves making API requests, using this plugin could flag your account. Use at your own risk!**
